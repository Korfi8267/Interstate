# The Interstate

### About
This is a personal website I'm currently developing with Vue + Tailwind. I plan to upload it at some point but if you'd like you can take a sneak peak here. I plan to add a portfolio containing a selection of photographs I've taken, as well as concepts I've designed. I may also include a separate packages page for iOffice to be available at.

## Features
### Home
The Home page features a basic set of information regarding who I am, my work, and my plans. It also contains buttons to view my work and to contact me.

### Portflio (unfinished)
The Portfolio page includes things I'm notably known for, such as iOffice and projects Ontario and Monterey. It'll have a carousel at the top showcasing a few featured items, and below will be a grid of older projects.

### Packages (unfinished)
The Packages page will be a bit small, really only hosting iOffice and perhaps a collage of images I've taken. However it will be the location of the latest announcement, but that's subject to change.

### Contact
The Contact page is planned to be merged with the Home Page to save on resources and to clean up general code.

## Known Issues
### M.B.S. link nonfunctional
This is intentional, as I want to wait until the site is essentially complete before adding an invite to a server which I do not own. I believe this is the best option, as I want to play it safe.

## Wrapping Up
If you want to keep up with development, bookmark this website. I'll regularly (not really) update this repo with the latest changes I've made. No release date planned. I want to take my time on it.
