# The Interstate

### About
This is a personal website I'm currently developing with Vue + Tailwind. I plan to upload it at some point but if you'd like you can take a sneak peak here. I plan to add a portfolio containing a selection of photographs I've taken, as well as concepts I've designed. I may also include a separate packages page for iOffice to be available at.

### Features
As of now, I do not have much implemented into this website. So, unless you like reading, it isn't all too impressive. The only functional area is the navbar at the top, and it's ONLY functional if it isn't in its mobile mode... thing.

### Wrapping Up
If you want to keep up with development, bookmark this website. I'll regularly (not really) update this repo with the latest changes I've made. No release date planned. I want to take my time on it.
