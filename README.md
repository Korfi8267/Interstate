# The Interstate

### About
This is a personal website I'm currently developing with Vue + Tailwind. I plan to upload it at some point but if you'd like you can take a sneak peak here. I plan to add a portfolio containing a selection of photographs I've taken, as well as concepts I've designed. I may also include a separate packages page for iOffice to be available at.

### Features
As of now, I do not have much implemented into this website. So, unless you like reading, it isn't all too impressive. The only functional area is the navbar at the top, and it's ONLY functional if it isn't in its mobile mode... thing.

## Known Issues
- Mobile NavBar being nonfunctional: This is nonfunctional as it has not been coded in yet. I don't plan on working on it anytime soon, as I want to get the actual pages done before worrying about making a mobile version. 
- Home Page rendered under contents of Packages/Portfolio: Not exactly sure what caused this. I believe it MAY have started when I made one header for each page? I've been trying to find it for a while but to no avail. If you have any suggestions please let me know, and I'd be more than happy to try them.

## Wrapping Up
If you want to keep up with development, bookmark this website. I'll regularly (not really) update this repo with the latest changes I've made. No release date planned. I want to take my time on it.
