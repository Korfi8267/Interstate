# The Interstate

### About
This is a personal website I'm currently developing with Vue + Tailwind. I plan to upload it at some point but if you'd like you can take a sneak peak here. I plan to add a portfolio containing a selection of photographs I've taken, as well as concepts I've designed. I may also include a separate packages page for iOffice to be available at.

## Features
### Home
The Home page features a basic set of information regarding who I am, my work, and my plans. It also contains buttons to view my work (Portfolio) and to contact me (not functional yet).

### Portflio (unfinished)
The Portfolio page includes things I'm notably known for, such as iOffice. It'll have a carousel at the top showcasing a few featured items, and below will be a grid of older announcements and/or designs.

### Packages (unfinished)
The Packages page will be a bit small, really only hosting iOffice and perhaps a collage of images I've taken. As I make more projects or collages, they will show up here for download.

### Contact (unfinished)
The Contact page will host ways you can find me, such as my twitter, my discord, and more. It will also include my profile icon for funsies.

## Known Issues
### Mobile NavBar being nonfunctional
This is nonfunctional as it has not been coded in yet. I don't plan on working on it anytime soon, as I want to get the actual pages done before worrying about making a mobile version. 

### Contact Me button nonfunctional
This is intentional for the time being as I'm focusing on completing the other pages. View My Work would be a redirect to Portfolio, and Contact Me would be a list of ways you can, well, contact me.

## Wrapping Up
If you want to keep up with development, bookmark this website. I'll regularly (not really) update this repo with the latest changes I've made. No release date planned. I want to take my time on it.
