# The Interstate

## About
This is a personal website I'm currently developing with Vue + Tailwind. I plan to upload it at smoe point but if you'd like you can take a sneak peak here. I plan to add a portfolio containing a selection of photographs I've taken, as well as concepts I've designed. I may also include a separate packages page for iOffice to be available at.

### Wrapping Up
If you want to keep up with development, bookmark this website. I'll regularly (not really) update this repo with the latest changes I've made. No release date planned. I want to take my time on it.
